    This website is the early process of me trying to create my own portfolio, unfortunately I don't have too many projects
    so it will be bare bones for now. I will try to update it as I go along and learn more about engineering, and finish more projects.
    I hope to have a more complete portfolio in the future. <br>

    I am currently a student at UMass Amherst, majoring in Computer Engineering.
