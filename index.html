  <p>In this project, I was grouped with 2 mechanical engineering students, 1 electrical engineering student, and 1 other computer engineering student. 
    <br>
    First figured out what we were gonna do, which was an arm controlled by potentiometers, then our mechanical engineering majors used 3D modeling software, namely solidworks to create the model.
    <br>
    Then we coded an ESP32 WROOM to manipulate servo motors using potentiometers while waiting for our supplies to be shipped to us.
    <br> 
    The waiting took a few months, but after that we attempted to put the robot together, but it didn't work, and by that time we were almost at the end of the semester and were swamped with work. 
    <br>
    Unfortunately the robot arm was not completed, but I learned a lot from this experience. Like how to program an ESP, how 3D modeling works, working in a team, etc.
    <br>
    But we still have the code to the robot arm.
